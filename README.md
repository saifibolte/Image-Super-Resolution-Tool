# ðŸ“ˆ Image Super Resolution Tool

This project is a **Gradio-based ESRGAN Image Upscaler** deployed on **Hugging Face Spaces**. It uses the **Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network (ESRGAN)** model to upscale low-resolution images by 4x while preserving details and enhancing quality.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Upload multiple low-resolution images  
- Automatically upscale using **ESRGAN (x4 factor)**  
- Preview upscaled images in the browser  
- Download all upscaled images as a **ZIP file**  
- Works on **GPU or CPU**  
- One-click deployment on Hugging Face Spaces - [View Live Demo](https://huggingface.co/spaces/saifibolte/TinyLlama-AI-Assistant) *(Runs on CPU, so generation may be slower)*

- Note: This Hugging Face Space is running on CPU, which means the image upscaling process can take longer compared to GPU-based environments, especially for high-resolution images. To ensure a smooth experience and faster results, we recommend testing with smaller or low-resolution images. For your convenience, we have provided a set of sample images in the low_res folder. You can use these images to quickly test the upscaling functionality on this Space.
